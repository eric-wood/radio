radio
=====

I have a beautiful radio cabinet from the 1940s laying around...unfortunately the original electronics are beyond repair. So rather than a full restoration, I'm taking things into my own hands and rebuilding the insides.

### Goals
* Play music from pandora with the help of [pianobar](http://6xq.net/projects/pianobar/)
* Interface with the knobs and buttons!

### Hardware
* Raspberry Pi (the brains)
* Arduino (GPIO)
* Vacuum fluorescent display
* Knobs and buttons 'n stuff

### Software Dependencies
* Ruby! (of course)
* [pianobar](http://6xq.net/projects/pianobar/)
* Some assumptions made in the config file...be sure to edit that!

#### This project is currently being worked on! I've only just begun on this journey...
